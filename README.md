# Calculator

The purpose of this project is to create a basic calculator to perform basic math equations.

The program will need to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers together.

These numbers will also need to be stored so that the calulator can continue to perform math functions once one has been computed.

There will also need to be the ability to clear the calculator when required and reset it to zero.
